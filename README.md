# TransApp
Android application prototype for a school project @ Czech Technical University.

This prototype  was done for the course Software Engineering I at Czech Technical University from Prague during the Winter Semester, 2015.

This prototype is about a ticket selling app, it lets you select several options according the the user needs, i.e. origin, destination, date.
The app will query available trips and show them to the user. If no trips are available for the given day the user will receive
an alert. If you want to book you will need to create an account first. TransApp uses Firebase BaaS, all information related to the
database can be seen here: https://strans.firebaseio.com/
